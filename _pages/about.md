Welcome! I am Avishree Khare, a 3rd-year Computer Science undergraduate at BITS Pilani, K. K. Birla Goa campus. I am interested in Deep learning and its applications in Computer Vision. I have recently started exploring Reinforcement Learning, specifically in the contexts of Malware detection and Cognitive Neuroscience.

I am currently a summer intern at [Tessellate Imaging](https://www.tessellateimaging.com/) where I contribute to the [Monk](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/monk_v1/tree/master/monk) library. Last summer, I interned at [CSIR-IGIB](https://www.igib.res.in/) last summer where I worked on Detection of Intracranial Hemorrhage from brain CT scans.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
