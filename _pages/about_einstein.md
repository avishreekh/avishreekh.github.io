Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Welcome! I am Avishree Khare, a Software Engineer at Google. I recently recieved a B.E. in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, K. K. Birla Goa campus. I am interested in Deep learning and its applications in Computer Vision. I have also recently started exploring Reasoning, Representation Learning and Incremental Learning in Neural Networks.

Prior to joining Google, I was an SWE Intern at Apple India. I have also been a summer intern at [CSIR-IGIB](https://www.igib.res.in/), where I worked on Detection of Intracranial Hemorrhage from brain CT scans.

I enjoy reading and hence have a [little section](/books/) dedicated to my personal favourites (suggestions are always welcome :smile:). I also enjoy writing articles on subjects that interest me ([another little section](/blog/) dedicated to that).
