Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/">Prof. Rajeev Alur</a>.

I am broadly interested in research topics at the intersection of Machine Learning
and Formal Methods. My research currently aims to: 
- Evaluate the formal reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Augment LLMs with formal techniques to build more trustworthy systems  

Prior to joining Penn, I was a Research Fellow with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/">PROSE group at Microsoft </a>.
I also spent a year as a Software Engineer at Google. Before that, I graduated with a B.E in Computer Science from BITS Pilani Goa, India.

In my spare time, I enjoy running, (pen) sketching and baking bread!
